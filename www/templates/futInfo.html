				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Futsal is a variant of association football that is mainly played indoors. Its name is derived from the Portuguese futebol de salÃ£o and theSpanish fÃºtbol sala/de salÃ³n, which can be translated as 'indoor football'.</br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Madrid 1985 the name fÃºtbol de salÃ³n and all other names the game was called were changed officially and internationally into FUTSAL.</br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Futsal is played between two teams of five players, one of whom is the goalkeeper, and up to seven substitutes per team. Unlike some other forms of indoor football, the game is played on a hard court surface delimited by lines; walls or boards are not used. </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Futsal is also played with a smaller ball with less bounce than a regulation football. The rules create an emphasis on improvisation, creativity and technique as well as ball control and passing in small spaces.
